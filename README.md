# Friday Night Funkin' - Editor's Cut
### About? I think?
This is obviously the repository for Editor's Cut (vsKeko) source code........... I think?

### Setting up everything
If you haven't already, follow the Build Instruction section on the [Friday Night Funkin' Repository](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin), 
for the Psych Engine stuff, you will also need to install LuaJIT. You can do this with:
```
haxelib install linc_luajit`
```
...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
