1.0.1;
- Added an up-to-date screen!\nLetting you know when your game is... not up-to-date?
- The Toaster Gamer achievement now displays its right icon.
Now you can look at a toaster, in its full glory! 
- Made most, if not all, achievements possible!
Because some weren't, sorry~
- Unfucked the difficulty labels.
Now it's "Normal to Hard" instead of "Easy to Normal"
